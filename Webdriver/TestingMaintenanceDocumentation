#4)Need to create prod: 'abcd' 'xyz' for the test user, and 'InvuePro1''InvuePro2' for invueprod.

#Assign Accessory:

#Update the accessory id.

#Setup Users Or Groups:
#1)User search: create user 'abcd' 'xyz' before testing.
#2)Assign User Group:
#3)Need to delete 'setupUsersOrGroupsNewUserGroup' after testing.
#4)Create Duplicate User Group: DuplicateUserGroup
#5)Need to delete user group 'DuplicateSuccess' after testing.
#6)Need to create 'EditUserGroup' before testing.
#7)Need to delete user 'lastName, firstName' after testing.
#8)Need to create 'EditUser' before Testing.

#StoreHierarchy:
#1)Need to create 'companyTest' and 'storeGroupTest' before testing.
#2)Need to delete newCompany, newStoreGroup and newStore aftertesting..
#3)Need to delete the following after testing:
#storeHierarchyCompanyCopy =u"companyTest - Copy (1)"
#storeHierarchyStoreGroupCopy = u"storeGroupTest - Copy (1)"
#storeHierarchyStoreCopy = u"test - Copy (1)"

#Template Styles:
#1)Need to delete 'CreateTmp' after testing.
#2)Need to create templateStylesDuplicateTemp = u"DuplicateTmp" before testing...
#3)Need to create templateStylesModifyTmp = u"ModifyTmp"
#4)Need to create EditTmpSchedule = u"EditTmpSchedule"

#Create Loops:
#1)Need to delete: NewAttractLoop after testing.
#2)Need to create:assignLoops before testing.

Preprocess:
1.Step 1:
1)Login as user 'andrew/andrew'
2)Go to 'Store Hierarchy' page, create store 'Storetest'
3)Go to 'Setup Users Or Groups' page, create user 'yrtest/test' assign it to user group 2,give all the premissions for group 2.
4)Assign user 'yrtest' to 'Storetest'.
5) Go to 'Assign Media Groups' page under 'Store Hierarchy'. Assign media devices to the store which contains user 'yrtest'
Note: this step might should be manually implemented for now.

2.Step 2:
Login as user 'yrtest/test',
1)Upload Media:
*Create 'ModifyMediaGroup',find its id as 'uploadMediaModifyMediaGroupId'
*Create 'TestMediaGroup', find its id as 'uploadMediaGroupID'
*Find media with title 'MediaEditTest.avi', find its id as 'uploadMediaMediumID'

2)Classify Products:
*Create category named as 'test', find its id as 'classifyProductsCategoryId'
*Create subcategory under category 'test' named as 'subCategoryOptions', find its id as 'classfiyProductsSubCategoryId'
*Create keyword under category 'test' named as 'keywordOptions', find its id as 'classifyProductsKeywordId'

3)Create Products:
*Create Manufacture named as 'ManTest', find its id as 'createProductsManufactureId'
*Create Prod1 named as 'abcd', find its id as 'createProductsProduct1ID'
*Create Prod1 named as 'xyz', find its id as 'createProductsProduct2ID'
*Create Acc1 named as 'acc1', find its id as 'createProductsAcc1ID'
*Create Prod1 named as 'acc2', find its id as 'createProductsAcc2ID'

4)Setup Users Or Groups:
*Create User1:'setupUsersOrGroupsSearchUser1'fn:ab, ln:cd, email:abcd@abcd.com; Login:abcd, pwd: test/test; find its id as setupUsersOrGroupsSearchUser1ID
*Create User2:'setupUsersOrGroupsSearchUser2' fn:xyz, ln:xyz, email:xyz@xyz.com; login: xyz, pwd:test/test; find its id as setupUsersOrGroupsSearchUser2D
*Create User3:'setupUsersOrGroupsEditUser' fn:editUser; ln:edituser; email: editUser@test.com; login:editUser; pwd:test/test; find its id as setupUsersOrGroupsEditUserID
*Create UserGroup:setupUsersOrGroupsDuplicateUserGroup named as 'u"DuplicateUserGroup"', find its id as setupUsersOrGroupsDuplicateUserGroupID
*Create UserGroup:setupUsersOrGroupsEditUserGroup = u"EditUserGroup", find its id as setupUsersOrGroupsEditUserGroupID

5)Store Hierarchy:
*Create Company:
storeHierarchyCompanyID = "28"
storeHierarchyCompany = u"companyTest"
storeHierarchyStoreGroupID = "27"
storeHierarchyStoreGroup = u"storeGroupTest"
storeHierarchyStoreID = "19"
storeHierarchyStore = u"Storetest"
storeHierarchyDuplicateStore = u"dStore"
storeHierarchyDuplicateStoreID = "60"
groupMediaPlayersAssignStoreID = "20"
groupMediaPlayersAssignStore = "assignStore"

6)Template Styles:
templateStylesDuplicateTemp = u"DuplicateTmp"
templateStylesDuplicateTempID = "225"
templateStylesModifyTmp = u"ModifyTmp"
templateStylesModifyTmpID = "227"
EditTmpSchedule = u"EditTmpSchedule"
EditTmpScheduleID ="74"

7)Create Loops:
assignLoops = u"assignLoops"
assignLoopsID= "232"
video1ID = "118"
video1 =u"AVI_to_MPEG-4.avi"
video2ID = "69"
video2 = u"MediaEditTest.avi"
EditNameOfLoop= u"EditNameOfLoop"
EditAttractLoopID="233"
